# ROS Workshop
##### `Work in Progress`

This repo will currently contain all the planned content as well as any new files that are useful in the course preparation stage. When the course is finalized, a new repo with a descriptive readme file will allow students to navigate through the course material and relevant files as well as contain installation instructions for any relevant course-required package.

## Course ILOs:  
1. Gain a working understanding of ROS and the ROS ecosystem
    - Understand the need for ROS
    - Are familiar with the ROS file system
    - Can work with, download, install, and create ROS packages
2. Gain hands-on experience with different SLAM packages, both in real life and in simulation settings
    - Can SLAM using the ROS2 Navigation Stack
    - Can sucessfully navigate and map an unknown arena using Turtlebot3 and the ROS2 navigation stack - `Reach Objective`

## Planned Course Content

### Unit 0 - Prerequisites
These are topics  that all students need to have some familiarity with to allow the course to flow smoothly:
- **Linux Operating System**
  - What is the linux operating system  
  - The Linux Terminal , i.e: Common Bash Commands, how to navigate using the terminal
- **Github**
    - What is Github and why is it used
    - How to navigate through repositories / Understand the general layout of repositories and how to navigate through commits
    - How to clone repositories using the command line or through the VS Code Github extension
- **Linear Algebra** - `Work in Progress` , `Need Feedback`
    - Necessary Linear Algebra topics for mobile robotics (i.e: Transforms and/or topics required to compute odometry information)
        - <mark>Matrices? (Do they need to understand specifics or just be familiar with them?)

### Unit 1 - Intro to ROS
This will be the first introduction to ROS and will cover the following:
- **Why ROS?**
  - What is ROS?
  - Why is ROS the new standard and what sparked the need for it 
- **The ROS Framework**
    - Brief introduction to the ROS filesystem
    - Nodes
    - Topics
    - Messages and Message types
    - Common ROS Commands through the command line
- **Milestone 1 :** - `Work in Progress`
    - Create a simple talker and listener nodes that can communicate through a shared topic
    
### Unit 2 - The ROS Ecosystem*
This unit should cover the ROS filesystem, how to download and install packages, and how to create your own simple package:
- Introduction to the ROS Workspace
    - What are buildtools? 
    - Introduction to Colcon (Previously Catkin)
- ROS Packages
    - What are ROS Packages?
    - How to download and install ROS packages
    - How to create a simple ROS package
- Launch Files
    - What are launch files
    - How to use launch files (parametric launch files), edit launch files, and create custom launch files
- Gazebo*
    - Introduction to Gazebo (What is it, why is it used)
    - ... ?
- Rviz*
    - Introduction to Rviz (What is it, why is it used)
    - ... ?
- **Milestone 2** - `Work in Progress`
    - Install and use the Turtlebot3 Gazebo Simulation and operate using teleop

### Unit 3 - SLAM*
This unit will cover the use of the built-in ROS navigation stack to SLAM and navigate using Turtlebot3. This unit still needs time before its scope is fully defined as time is needed to practice and become familiar with the new navigation stack before the content can be outlined.
